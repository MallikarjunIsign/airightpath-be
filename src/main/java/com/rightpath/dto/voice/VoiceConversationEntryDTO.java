/**
 * One turn of an interview, as the reviewer's transcript needs it.
 *
 * <p>The conversation endpoint used to return {@link VoiceConversationEntry}
 * itself. Its {@code interviewSchedule} is a lazy {@code @ManyToOne}, so
 * serialising the entity outside a transaction made Jackson touch an
 * uninitialised proxy and the request answered 500 — the transcript tab in the
 * interview results was empty for every interview ever held.</p>
 *
 * <p>A projection also settles what belongs in a transcript. The schedule is not
 * part of it: the caller asked for one schedule's conversation and already knows
 * which. Everything here is either what was said or a measurement of how it was
 * said, and {@code codeOutput} is included because the model was shown it when
 * scoring — a reviewer without it reads a different transcript than the one that
 * produced the score.</p>
 *
 * @param id                     this turn's id
 * @param interviewScheduleId    the interview it belongs to
 * @param role                   INTERVIEWER, CANDIDATE or SYSTEM
 * @param content                what was said, code and run output included for
 *                               candidate turns
 * @param wordCount              words spoken
 * @param wordsPerMinute         speaking pace
 * @param fillerWordCount        "um", "like", and the rest
 * @param confidenceScore        0-100, from tone analysis
 * @param speechDurationSeconds  how long they spoke
 * @param codeContent            code written for this answer, if any
 * @param codeLanguage           the language it was written in
 * @param codeOutput             what it printed when last run
 * @param timestamp              when the turn was recorded
