/**
 * The rules the interviewer must follow whatever a job's prompt happens to say.
 *
 * <p>Each job configures its own interview prompt, so the wording, seniority and
 * subject matter are the recruiter's to set. But a handful of rules are not
 * editorial — they are the contract between the model and the rest of the
 * system, and an interview breaks in a way the candidate sees if any of them is
 * missing:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>One question per turn. Two questions in one reply and the candidate
 *       answers whichever they remember, while the transcript records both as
 *       asked.</li>
 *   <li>Coding questions carry a {@code [CODING]} tag. The candidate's editor
 *       only appears when the frontend sees that tag, so an untagged coding
 *       question asks someone to write code with nowhere to write it.</li>
 *   <li>A closing marker. Without one the interview can only end by exhausting
 *       its question budget, so a candidate who has clearly finished keeps
 *       being asked.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than appended to each job's prompt text so there is one
 * copy to correct, and so a recruiter editing their prompt cannot delete them by
 * accident.</p>
