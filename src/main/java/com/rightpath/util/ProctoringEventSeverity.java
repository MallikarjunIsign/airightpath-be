/**
 * Which proctoring events count against a candidate, and which are only a
 * record of what happened.
 *
 * <p>Every event the client sent used to increment the warning count, and the
 * count is what fails an interview: at the ceiling the schedule is marked
 * {@code FAILED} with {@code PROCTORING_VIOLATION} and the interview ends. So
 * a candidate whose recordings uploaded perfectly collected two warnings for
 * it — one for the camera, one for the screen — because the upload reports
 * {@code recording_uploaded} through the same channel. Resuming a screen share
 * after an accidental stop cost another, on top of the one for stopping.</p>
 *
 * <p>It went unnoticed because the ceiling is set very high in the
 * environments this was tested in. Somewhere with a realistic ceiling, a
 * candidate who did nothing wrong fails for successfully uploading their own
 * evidence.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Which way to fail</h2>
 *
 * <p>Unknown event types <strong>count</strong>. The two mistakes available
 * are not symmetrical, but neither is safe: silently ignoring a real violation
 * guts the proctoring, while silently counting an informational event fails an
 * innocent candidate. Counting by default means a new violation is caught the
 * day it is added, and a new informational event shows up as an obviously
 * wrong warning rather than as nothing at all — which is the mistake that gets
 * noticed and fixed. Anything informational must be named here.</p>
